/*A series of ideas for a "satisfying" lotto number picker
(because humans don't like clustered numbers.)
1. Ranges with Random
2. Dynamic ranges with random
3. Dynamic adaptive random
4. Consider "intelligent exclusion" (this may be some work, and will definitely be outside scope.)

This is all about the customer getting a "satisfying" lotto number that is
at least PARTIALLY random.  Clusters are not satisfying, even though they occur naturally in true random numbers.
